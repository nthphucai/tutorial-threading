# Violence Detection Pipeline

This repository contains models for violence detection and YOLO-based pose estimation. The system is designed to detect violent actions in video streams using computer vision techniques.

## Models

### Violence Detection Model

The violence detection model is responsible for analyzing pose data and predicting the likelihood of violence. The model is trained to recognize patterns indicative of violent actions.

### YOLO-based Pose Estimation Model

The YOLO-based pose estimation model extracts human poses from video frames. It plays a crucial role in providing input data for the violence detection model.
